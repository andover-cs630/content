With the `astro-m2dx` plugin, relative links to images can be included in `.mdx` files in another way. Instead of using explicit `import` statements and `<img>` tags, the syntax for embedding images is the same as classic Markdown: `![alt_text](src "title")`. Compare the source file of this article with the previous example.
