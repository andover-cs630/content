import poly from "./poly-grid.svg"
import peaks from "./stacked-peaks.svg"
import campus from "./campus.jpg"

In `.mdx` files (**not** `.md` files!), images can be included using relative imports and the `<img>` tag. This allows images to be colocated with the articles they belong to instead of putting every article image in the `public` directory.

Note that `<img>` tags must take the form `<img ... />` instead of `<img ... >` in MDX, despite being valid HTML [void elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html-markup-20110113/syntax.html#void-element).

## Example Gallery

<img src={peaks} alt="A gradient of jagged color bands"/>

<img src={campus} alt="A picture of the Phillips Academy campus during winter"/>
